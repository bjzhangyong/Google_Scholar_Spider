One important shortcoming of this literature is that it ignores the distinction between horizontal and vertical IIT and ignores the fact that they may have different determinants. This paper disaggregates UK IIT into its horizontal and vertical components and, using bilateral trade data, estimates a series of models incorporating countryspecific variables. The results suggest that vertical IIT is more important in the UK than horizontal IIT and that the inter-country pattern of vertical IIT is systematically related to a range of explanatory variables...L?nderspezifische Faktoren und das Muster des horizontalen und vertikalen intraindustriellen Handels des Vereinigten K?nigreichs. - In einer gro?en Zahl empirischer Studien wurde die Beziehung zwischen l?nderspezifischen Faktoren und dem gesamten intraindustriellen Handel (IIH) untersucht. Ein bedeutender Mangel dieser Studien ist, da? sie die Unterscheidung zwischen horizontalem und vertikalem IIH ebenso vernachl?ssigen wie die Tatsache, da? diese unterschiedliche Bestimmungsgr?nde haben k?nnen. Die Autoren zerlegen den britischen IIH in seine horizontalen und vertikalen Komponenten und sch?tzen unter Verwendung bilateraler Handelsdaten eine Reihe von Modellen, die l?nderspezifische Variable enthalten.

Resource-Conserving Agriculture Increases Yields in Developing Countries - Environmental Science & Technology (ACS Publications)
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es051670d

[]

Despite great recent progress, hunger and poverty remain widespread and agriculturally driven environmental damage is widely prevalent. The idea of agricultural sustainability centers on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, and that lead to improvements in food productivity. Here we show the extent to which 286 recent interventions in 57 poor countries covering 37 M ha (3% of the cultivated area in developing countries) have increased productivity on 12.6 M farms while improving the supply of critical environmental services. The average crop yield increase was 79% (geometric mean 64%). All crops showed water use efficiency gains, with the highest improvement in rainfed crops. Potential carbon sequestered amounted to an average of 0.35 t C ha.. y... If a quarter of the total area under these farming systems adopted sustainability enhancing practices, we estimate global sequestration could be 0.1 Gt C y... Of projects with pesticide data, 77% resulted in a decline in pesticide use by 71% while yields grew by 42%. Although it is uncertain whether these approaches can meet future food needs, there are grounds for cautious optimism, particularly as poor farm households benefit more from their adoption. ..Citation data is made available by participants in ..

 An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X00000317

[]

, August 2000, Pages 113?136..This trans-disciplinary study assesses total external environmental and health costs of modern agriculture in the UK. A wide range of datasets have been analysed to assess cost distribution across sectors. We calculate the annual total external costs of UK agriculture in 1996 to be ?2343 m (range for 1990?1996: ?1149?3907 m), equivalent to ?208/ha of arable and permanent pasture. Significant costs arise from contamination of drinking water with pesticides (?120 m/year), nitrate (?16 m), .. (?23 m) and phosphate and soil (?55 m), from damage to wildlife, habitats, hedgerows and drystone walls (?125 m), from emissions of gases (?1113 m), from soil erosion and organic carbon losses (?106 m), from food poisoning (?169 m), and from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (?607 m). This study has only estimated those externalities that give rise to financial costs, and so is likely to underestimate the total negative impacts of modern agriculture. These data help to identify policy priorities, particularly over the most efficient way to internalise these external costs into prices. This would imply a redirection of public subsidies towards encouraging those positive externalities under-provided in the market place, combined with a mix of advisory and institutional mechanisms, regulatory and legal measures, and economic instruments to correct negative externalities. Further work examining the marginal costs and benefits of UK agriculture would help to inform future policy development...Copyright ? 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abnormal folate metabolism and mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene may be maternal risk factors for Down
         syndrome 
      
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/4/495.short

[]

               ..                           .. Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is a complex genetic disease resulting from the presence of 3 copies of chromosome 21. The                     origin of the extra chromosome is maternal in 95% of cases and is due to the failure of normal chromosomal segregation during                     meiosis. Although advanced maternal age is a major risk factor for trisomy 21, most children with Down syndrome are born to                     mothers <30 y of age.                  .. On the basis of evidence that abnormal folate and methyl metabolism can lead to DNA hypomethylation and abnormal chromosomal                     segregation, we hypothesized that the C-to-T substitution at nucleotide 677 (677C?T) mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate                     reductase (..) gene may be a risk factor for maternal meiotic nondisjunction and Down syndrome in young mothers.                  .. The frequency of the .. 677C?T mutation was evaluated in 57 mothers of children with Down syndrome and in 50 age-matched control mothers. Ratios                     of plasma homocysteine to methionine and lymphocyte methotrexate cytotoxicity were measured as indicators of functional folate                     status.                  .. A significant increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations and lymphocyte methotrexate cytotoxicity was observed in the                     mothers of children with Down syndrome, consistent with abnormal folate and methyl metabolism. Mothers with the 677C?T mutation                     had a 2.6-fold higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome than did mothers without the T substitution (odds ratio: 2.6;                     95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; .. < 0.03).                  .. The results of this initial study indicate that folate metabolism is abnormal in mothers of children with Down syndrome and                     that this may be explained, in part, by a mutation in the .. gene.                  ..

Cutting though the exaggerated and fanciful beliefs about the new possibilities of "net life", Hine produces a distinctive understanding of the significance of the Internet and addresses such questions as: what challenges do the new technologies of communication pose for research methods? Does the Internet force us to rethink traditional categories of "culture" and "society?" In this compelling and thoughtful book, Hine shows that the Internet is both a site for cultural formations and a cultural artifact which is shaped by people's understandings and expectations.

 Reducing food poverty by increasing agricultural sustainability in developing countries
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880902000877

[]

, April 2003, Pages 217?234..We examined the extent to which farmers have improved food production in recent years with low cost, locally available and environmentally sensitive practices and technologies. We analysed by survey during 1999?2000 208 projects in 52 developing countries, in which 8.98 million farmers have adopted these practices and technologies on 28.92 million hectares, representing 3.0% of the 960 million hectares of arable and permanent crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We found improvements in food production occurring through one or more of four mechanisms: (i) intensification of a single component of farm system; (ii) addition of a new productive element to a farm system; (iii) better use of water and land, so increasing cropping intensity; (iv) improvements in per hectare yields of staples through introduction of new regenerative elements into farm systems and new locally appropriate crop varieties and animal breeds. The 89 projects with reliable yield data show an average per project increase in per hectare food production of 93%. The weighted average increases across these projects were 37% per farm and 48% per hectare. In the 80 projects with small (<5?ha) farms where cereals were the main staples, the 4.42 million farms on 3.58 million hectares increased household food production by 1.71?t per year. We report on the practices and technologies that have led to these increases: increased water use efficiency, improvements to soil health and fertility, and pest control with minimal or zero-pesticide use. This research reveals promising advances in the adoption of practices and technologies that are likely to be more sustainable, with substantial benefits for the rural poor. With further explicit support, particularly through national policy reforms and better markets, these improvements in food security could spread to much larger numbers of farmers and rural people in the coming decades...Copyright ? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Research from JAMA Internal Medicine ? Meta-analytic Evidence Against Prophylactic Use of Lidocaine in Acute Myocardial Infarction

? Although lidocaine prophylaxis reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation during acute myocardial infarction (AMI), randomized control trials (RCTs) have not demonstrated any significant mortality effect of this therapy. We conducted a meta-analysis of 14 RCTs of lidocaine prophylaxis during AMI to detect any mortality effect. Six prehospital- and eight hospital-phase RCTs that randomized totals of 7656 and 1407 patients, respectively, were selected and reviewed in a blinded fashion. Mortality data were evaluated according to therapy type, reporting interval, and patient category. The prehospital-phase RCTs showed no meaningful mortality effect (risk difference, 0.0184; 95% confidence interval, ?0.048 to +0.012). The hospital-phase RCTs showed a statistically significant increase in mortality during the treatment period for lidocaine recipients (risk difference, 0.029; 95% confidence interval, +0.004 to +0.055). These results confirm that lidocaine administered to monitored patients during the prehospital phase of AMI will not reduce mortality by a clinically important amount and suggest that lidocaine administered in the hospital phase of monitored, uncomplicated AMI may increase mortality among recipients with proved AMI...(.. 1989;149:2694-2698)..Thank you for submitting a comment on this article.

Chronic elevation of SAH, secondary to the homocysteine-mediated reversal                     of the SAH hydrolase reaction, reduces methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and phospholipids. High affinity binding of SAH                     to the active site of cellular methyltransferases results in product inhibition of the enzyme. Using a sensitive new high                     pressure liquid chromatography method with coulometric electrochemical detection, plasma SAH levels in healthy young women                     were found to increase linearly with mild elevation in homocysteine levels (.. = 0.73; .. < 0.001); however,..-adenosylmethionine levels were not affected. Plasma SAH levels were positively correlated with intracellular lymphocyte SAH                     levels (.. = 0.81; .. < 0.001) and also with lymphocyte DNA hypomethylation (.. = 0.74,.. < 0.001). These results suggest that chronic elevation in plasma homocysteine levels, such as those associated with nutritional                     deficiencies or genetic polymorphisms in the folate pathway, may have an indirect and negative effect on cellular methylation                     reactions through a concomitant increase in intracellular SAH levels.                  ..You'll be in good company...                           ..                                                   ..                           ..                                                   ..                           ..

[]

               ..                           ..A cross-sectional study was carried out among 39 current smokers (CS) and 60 noncurrent smokers (NCS) to evaluate the effects                     of cigarette smoking on folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations in the circulation and in tissues directly exposed to cigarette                     smoke. Univariate analysis showed significantly lower plasma, red blood cell (RBC), and buccal mucosa (BM) folate and BM vitamin                     B-12 concentrations in CS compared with NCS. The association between smoking and folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations in                     plasma, RBCs, and BM cells was reduced after other variables were controlled for. Total folate intake and plasma vitamin C                     concentrations were significant predictors of plasma and RBC folate concentrations. The plasma and RBC concentrations of folate                     were significantly lower in subjects who had last smoked < 1 h before the blood sample was drawn than in subjects who had                     smoked earlier. At the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for folate, CS had 42% lower plasma folate concentrations                     than NCS, whereas at an intake three times the RDA, the plasma folate concentration was the same for CS and NCS. The results                     also suggested that CS have BM folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations that are lower than those of NCS.                  ..

A Shining Thread of Hope chronicles the lives of black women from indentured servitude in the early American colonies to the cruelty of antebellum plantations, from the reign of lynch law in the Jim Crow South to the triumphs of the Civil Rights era. Tracing the accomplishments, as well as the suffering, of black women through the Great Migration, the Harlem Renaissance, the Depression, the Civil Rights movement, and the present day, Hine and Thompson challenge preconceived notions and move black women from the fringes of American history to a central position in our understanding of the forces and events that have shaped this country. More than a story of struggle, black women's history is very much a story of hope. In the face of great obstacles, black women strengthened their communities through the development of women's groups, charitable organizations, and political groups, and contributed to the larger community as writers, activists, educators, artists and leaders. A Shining Thread of Hope reveals this history, presenting the strength and courage of black women, both as individuals and as a collective force for positive change.

 Food Allergies in Children Affect Nutrient Intake and Growth
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822302903512

[]

, November 2002, Pages 1648?1651.. To identify if specific food allergies, elimination diets, or other variables associated with food allergies have an impact on the growth and nutrient intake of children with food allergies... Measurements of height, weight, and body mass index were used to determine potential growth problems. Estimates of energy and nutrient intakes were based on 3-day diet records. A questionnaire was used to determine number of food allergies and other variables... Ninety-eight children with food allergies (subjects, mean age 3.7?2.3 years) and 99 children without food allergies (controls, mean age 4.1?2.4 years) participated in this age-matched, consecutive sampling, cross-sectional study... Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics using general association and Fisher Exact Test, with 2-sided probability, were conducted... Children with two or more food allergies were shorter, based on height-for-age percentiles, than those with one food allergy (..<.05). More than 25% of children in both groups consumed less than 67% of the DRI (RDA or AI) for calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin E. More children with cow's milk allergy or multiple food allergies consumed dietary calcium less than age-and gender-specific recommendations compared with children without cow's milk allergy and/or one food allergy. The possibility of consuming a less than recommended intake of calcium and vitamin D in children with food allergy was less if the child received nutrition counseling (..<.05) or consumed a safe infant/toddler formula or fortified soy beverage... Children diagnosed with food allergies need an annual nutrition assessment to prevent growth problems or inadequate nutrient intake. Children with milk allergies or multiple food allergies are at greater risk. Nutrition education needs to address how to avoid all forms of the allergen and incorporate alternative nutrient-dense foods. This population would benefit from the development and validation of a medical nutrition therapy protocol. ..Copyright ? 2002 American Dietetic Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

 An empirical assessment of the impact of trade on employment in the United Kingdom
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268099000233

[]

, September 1999, Pages 485?500..A large number of studies have recently attempted to evaluate the impact of trade on employment, many relying on either the factor content or growth accounting approaches. With some notable exceptions, this work finds limited evidence of strong direct effects but stronger effects through induced productivity changes. This study models the effects of trade on employment in the UK in a dynamic labour demand framework, on a panel of 167 manufacturing industries. We find that when we introduce trade, increases in trade volumes, both in terms of imports and exports, cause reductions in the level of derived labour demand. When we disaggregate by origin of imports we find stronger effects in trade with the EU and US compared to trade with East Asia. This provides supportive evidence for the idea that trade affects ..-inefficiency, with the strongest competition for UK manufacturers coming from producers in the EU and US...Copyright ? 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Patent US6099039 - Frame structure for sport utility vehicle or light truck - Google Patents
https://www.google.com/patents/US6099039

Improved structural and operational components for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and light truck vehicles. A hybrid vehicle structure utilizing structural subframes in the front and rear of the vehicle and a monocoque body structure in the center. A common subframe system is used for the front ends of both the sport utility vehicles and light truck vehicles. In addition, substantially the same subframe system is used for the rear end of the sports utility vehicle. A common suspension system is also used for the front ends of the SUVs and light truck vehicles. The same suspension system is also used for the rear end of the SUV. Use of common components and subsystems create significant savings in tooling and assembly costs. At the same time, the present invention maintains performance characteristics of the SUVs and light truck vehicles comparable to or exceeding the characteristics of SUVs and light truck vehicles in the same class. Triangular support framing structures are also used in the SUVs to provide optimum loading through the roof rail members. A common body structure, preferably a monocoque structure, is used for all of the vehicles from the "B" pillar forward. With the present invention, existing production plants and tooling can be utilized and the SUVs and light truck structures can be assembled on the same production line.

The present invention relates to improved structural and operational components for sports utility vehicles and light truck vehicles...Automotive and vehicle manufacturers today are striving to contain and/or reduce costs and meet global competition. In order to meet these goals, the automotive and vehicle manufacturers have tried various solutions. These solutions include reducing the mass and thus weight of the vehicles where possible or appropriate, reducing the number of individual and component parts of a vehicle, incorporating new manufacturing techniques, substituting different materials, particularly lighter weight materials, redesigning parts to reduce their weight, down-sizing the vehicle for its individual components, and applying design techniques that result in more efficient structures and use of materials. One of these design techniques also involves improving the aerodynamics of the vehicle and thus reducing their drag. Various improvements have also been made in vehicle engines and powertrain technology which are directed to meeting fuel economy standards...The majority of parts for most vehicles are made from steel materials. Steel has many proven advantages, such as low cost, excellent manufacturability, recyclability, and crash energy management capability. The redesign of steel parts and the ability to make the parts from various types, gauges, and strengths of steel materials, have helped create automobiles and vehicles having lower overall vehicle weight...The body shell of a vehicle (a/k/a "body-in-white") is the skeletal structure to which various subsystems subsequently are attached. These subsystems include the engine and drivetrain, suspension and wheels, interior components, and exterior body components, such as doors, glass, hood, and trunk lid. Since the body-in-white (BIW) typically represents approximately 20-25% of the total weight of a vehicle, efforts have been made to reduce the weight of the BIW. Any reductions in weight or use of different structures and materials, however, have to be done in cooperation with meeting various structural, rigidity, and dimensional parameters in order to produce a satisfactory vehicle...It is an object of the present invention to provide improved vehicle structures (especially BIWs) for sport utility vehicles (SUV) and light truck vehicles. It is another object of the present invention to provide improved structural and operational components for such vehicle structures...It is also an object of the present invention to provide vehicle structures for SUVs and light trucks which utilize a plurality of common components and thus which are less expensive to manufacture and assemble. At the same time, it is still another object of the present invention to provide improved structures and utilize common components while at the same time maintaining satisfactory performance characteristics of the vehicles...It is a further object of the present invention to provide a vehicle structure which has fewer and more standard components than known structures and which still has satisfactory performance characteristics which meet or exceed vehicles of the same type known today. It is another object of the present invention to provide SUV and light truck structures which have less mass and which are improvements over known structures and still meet requisite standards of structural integrity, crash worthiness and durability...These and other objects, purposes and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description thereof, when viewed in accordance with the attached drawings and appended claims...The present invention relates to systems and structures for improving the manufacture and assembly of various vehicles, particularly sport utility vehicles (SUV) and light trucks. The invention provides vehicle structures which utilize common components, both in the front and rear ends of the same vehicle, as well as in different vehicles. The use of common components allows manufacture and assembly of different vehicles on the same production line, and reduces tooling investment, component costing and expense, and assembly time. At the same time, the present invention maintains performance characteristics comparable to or exceeding vehicles of the same class...In particular, a common structural subframe system is used for both the front and rear ends of an SUV. The common subframe includes right and left rail members, a cradle member and a bumper member, and the subframe also absorbs crash and bumper loads. The structural subframes carry the suspension, steering and powertrain components in the front of the vehicle, and the suspension and differential in the rear of the vehicle. The center section of the SUV vehicle preferably is a monocoque structure which provides a savings in mass and weight over a fully framed vehicle. The monocoque structure comprises the center section of the SUV and is bolted on to the structural subframe systems in the front and rear of the vehicle making it a "hybrid" vehicle structure...The same structural subframe is also used for the front portions of light truck structure in accordance with the present invention. The light truck structure can be a pickup design with either a standard cab or an extended cab. The remainder of the frame of the light truck vehicle utilizes a conventional frame structure...In addition, the present invention provides a unique suspension system for the SUV in which the same components can be used for both the front and rear wheel suspension systems. Moreover, that same suspension system can be used for the front suspension in the light truck structures. The suspension system includes a double wishbone suspension with torsion bars, hydraulic shocks, and anti-roll bars. The suspension is mounted directly to the structural subframe for ease of installation and off-line adjustment...The engine mounting system and the rear differential mounting system share the same locations on the common subframe. The structural bumper crossmember on the subframe includes mountings for the radiator support, head lights, and other front end accessories for the front end, as well as mountings for the tail lights and other rear end accessories for the rear end...A front subframe strut joint is integrated into the "A" pillar of the vehicle as part of the upper and cowl joint. A smooth transition of the load path is provided from the front subframe strut through the roof rail. The body structure for both the SUV and light truck structures are common for the vehicles from the "A" pillar forward. With a continuous rail system, the same joints and connecting mechanisms can be used for both the SUV and light truck structures...A unique structure combining a triangulation of the "C" and "D" pillars provides optimum loading through the roof rail in the SUV. Another triangular structural system includes the "A" pillar in combination with a front rail member and cowl strut member...In the design of the vehicle in accordance with the present invention, certain structural performance targets are first selected. These targets generally include the mass (weight) of the body, as well as the static torsion, static bending, and first modes of vibration (frequency). The type of material used for the vehicle body is also selected, together with applicable wheel base, exterior and interior dimensions, curb weight, and towing capacity. Preferably, the vehicle structures are made primarily from a steel material...The present inventive structural and operational components for the SUV and light truck vehicles meet structural performance targets comparable with or exceeding standards for SUVs and light trucks in the same classes on the market today. The present invention also provides satisfactory crash test results, thus creating a useable and producible improved structure for final vehicle production...With the present invention, a highly rigid hybrid body with minimal mass can be created. The competing requirements of safety (crash worthiness) rigidity, cost, and weight reduction are balanced. New and improved bodies-in-white for SUVs and light truck vehicles are created. The bodies-in-white have tight packages with minimal outer space and maximum internal useable space, and meet customer and manufacture needs of comfort, manufacture and efficiency, fuel efficiency, and safety...In addition, the techniques used for manufacture and assembly of the body-in-white and its components for the SUVs and light truck structures are those conventionally in use today. Thus, in this manner, the invention can have immediate use and application and the benefits thereof can be promptly provided to and secured by manufacturers, their customers, and other members of the public...These and other features, details, and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention, when viewed in accordance with the attached drawings and appended claims...FIG. 1 illustrates a hybrid structure for a sport utility vehicle made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 2 illustrates a structure for a hybrid light truck vehicle made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 3 illustrates a hybrid structure for a light truck vehicle having an extended cab made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 4 illustrates a vehicle front end subframe system made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 5 is an exploded view of the front subframe system illustrated in FIG. 4;..FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate perspective views of a complete front subframe system and a partial front subframe system, respectively, made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 8 illustrates a vehicle rear end subframe system made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 9 is an exploded view of the rear subframe system shown in FIG. 8;..FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a rear subframe system made in accordance with the present invention;..FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate a full and a partial frame system, respectively, for light truck vehicles;..FIG. 13 depicts the joint or connecting mechanism between a subframe system and a frame structure in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 14 illustrates a front suspension system for use with vehicles in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 15 is an exploded view illustrating a portion of the front suspension system shown in FIG. 14;..FIG. 16 depicts a rear suspension system for a sport utility vehicle in accordance with the present invention;..FIGS. 17 and 18 illustrate a full and partial, respectively, rear suspension system for light truck structures in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 19 illustrates a steering system for use with vehicle structures in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 20 is an exploded view of a powertrain system for use with the vehicle structures made in accordance with the present invention;..FIG. 21 is a schematic depiction of a sport utility vehicle incorporating the present invention;..FIG. 22 is a schematic illustration of a standard cab light truck structure incorporating the present invention;..FIGS. 23-25 illustrate, respectively, monocoque body structures for sport utility, standard cab, and extended cab vehicles incorporating the present invention;..FIG. 26 is a schematic diagram illustrating a sport utility vehicle incorporating the present invention;..FIG. 27 illustrates the hybrid body structure of the sport utility vehicle shown in FIG. 26;..FIG. 28 illustrates the chassis portion of the sport utility vehicle shown in FIG. 26; and..FIGS. 29 and 30 illustrate triangular component structures for in a sport utility vehicle made in accordance with the present invention...FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 illustrate various hybrid body structures made in accordance with the present invention. These body shell structures are commonly called "body-in-white" structures and are the skeletal structure to which various subsystems of the vehicle subsequently are attached. The subsystems include the engine and drivetrain, suspension and wheels, interior components, and exterior body components, such as doors, hood, glass, and trunk lid. The body-in-white typically represents approximately 20-25% of the total weight of a vehicle and must meet various structural, rigidity, and crash worthiness standards in order to be used in production for a vehicle today...FIG. 1 illustrates a hybrid body shell 10 for a sport utility vehicle (SUV). FIG. 2 illustrates a hybrid body structure 20 for a standard cab light truck structure. FIG. 3 illustrates a hybrid body structure 30 for an extended cab light truck structure...Referring to FIG. 1, the SUV body structure includes a body member 12, a front structural subframe system 14, and a rear structural subframe system 16. The standard cab body structure 20 includes a cab body member 18, a front subframe system 14, and a frame structure 22. The extended cab body structure 30 includes a body member 24, a front subframe system 14, and a frame structure 22'...As evidenced by the use of common reference numerals, the front subframe system 14 used with all three of the vehicle structures 10, 20, and 30 is a common structural subframe system. In addition, the standard cab and extended cab body structures 20 and 30, respectively, utilize frame structures 22 and 22' which have the same components and differ only in length. Further, as pointed out below, the rear subframe system 16 used with the SUV is the same as the front subframe system 14 used with all of the vehicles...FIGS. 4-7 illustrate the front structural subframe system 14 used with the SUV and light truck structures. In this regard, FIG. 4 illustrates the assembled front subframe system, FIG. 5 is an exploded view depicting the various parts and components of the front subframe system, FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating the assembled front subframe system, and FIG. 7 is a perspective view illustrating a portion of the front subframe system...The front subframe system 14 is a structural subframe which absorbs crash and bumper loads. The system 14 includes a front bumper member 32, a right-hand rail member 34, a left-hand rail member 36, a cradle member 38, and a pair of strut members 40...As shown in FIG. 5, the front bumper member 32 includes an outer bumper member 41 and an inner bumper member 42. The right-hand rail member 34 includes an outer rail member 43 and an inner rail member 44. The left-hand rail member 36 includes an outer rail member 45 and an inner rail member 46...The cradle member 38 includes a number of various components, including a right front outer member 47, a right front inner member 48, a left front outer member 49, and a left front inner member 50, as well as a pair of cross-members 51 and 52. A pair of U-shaped nodes or joint connecting mechanisms 53 and 54 are connected (preferably welded) to the ends of the right rail member 34 and left rail member 36, respectively. The nodes are used to connect the front subframe system 14 to other portions of the body structure...A pair of plate members 55 are attached to the ends of the right and left rail members 34 and 36, as shown in the drawings. The plate members are used to attach the bumper member 32 to the side rail members...As indicated above, the same front structural subframe system 14 is utilized for the SUV structure 10 and the two light truck vehicle structures 20 and 30. The subframe system 14 is a structural unit which mounts to a frame-type rail system in an adjacent portion of the appropriate vehicle. This allows the use of a 5 mph bumper system to be combined with a front structural cross-member in the rear portions of the rail members. It is also possible to provide the radiator support, hood hinge mounting brackets, and the headlight mounting brackets on the front subframe system, such as on the bumper member 32 and/or right and left rail members 34 and 36, respectively...The upper and lower portions of the side rail members of the subframe system 14 are also adapted to mount the suspension structure or system for the SUV. The front subframe system also includes mounting members for mounting the engine in the cradle member 38...As indicated above, the rear subframe system 16 for the sport utility vehicle is a structural framework and is the same as the front subframe system 14. In this regard, the rear subframe system 16 is shown in FIGS. 8-10. FIG. 8 is an outline-type perspective view of the subframe system 16, FIG. 9 is an exploded view depicting the various components of the subframe system 16, and FIG. 10 is a perspective view of the subframe system 16...In the front subframe system 14, members and brackets for mounting the accessories and components which normally fit in or on the front end of a vehicle are attached to the front subframe system. These components include the engine of the vehicle, the front suspension, the steering system, the radiator and cooling system, headlights, hood hinges, and the like...Since the rear subframe system 16 is the same as the front subframe system 14 and includes the same components, the various members and components shown in FIGS. 8, 9 and 10 are referenced by the same reference numerals. In this regard, the rear subframe system 16 includes a rear bumper member 32, a first side rail member 34, a second side rail member 36, and a cradle member 38. (Cowl struts similar to members 40 shown with respect to FIGS. 4-7 are not used with the rear subframe system.)..The bumper member 32 includes an outer member 41 and an inner member 42. The first rail member 34 includes an outer member 43 and an inner member 44. The second rail member 36 includes an outer rail member 45 and an inner rail member 46. The cradle member includes a first outer member 47, a first inner member 48, a second outer member 49, a second inner member 50, and a pair of cross members 51 and 52. The rear subframe system 16 also includes a pair of U-shaped joint nodes 53 and 54 connected (i.e. welded) to the side rail members, and a pair of rail plates 55...The rear subframe system 16 is adapted to house and mount vehicle components normally positioned in the rear of the vehicle. These components include the rear differential, the rear suspension system, the fuel tank, the spare tire, and mounting brackets for rear taillights. In order to provide a common bumper member 32 for use with both the front and rear subframe systems, it is preferable to have all of the mounting holes and brackets associated with the front of the vehicle positioned on one edge 32a of the bumper member, and to have the mounting holes and brackets for the components positioned in the rear of the vehicle on the other edge 32b of the bumper member 32 (see FIG. 10). This means, when the subframe system is being assembled for the vehicle, the bumper member 32 is turned 180? depending on whether the subframe system is going to be used for the front or rear of the vehicle...A relatively conventional frame system is used for the mid and rear portions of the light truck structures 20 and 30. This frame structure is shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, with FIG. 11 showing a complete frame structure and FIG. 12 showing a partial frame structure. As indicated, substantially the same frame structures are used for both the standard cab and extended cab light truck structures. The two structures 22 and 22' use the same components with the only difference being the length of the side rail members...The frame structures 22 and 22' include a right rail member 60 and a left rail member 62. Several cross members are positioned between the two rail members 60 and 62. These cross-members include a torsion bar cross-member 64, and a pair of bed support and fuel tank support members 66 and 68. The spare tire also mounts on the support members 66 and 68. A rear bumper 70 is also attached to the ends of the rail members. (Preferably, the bumper member is the same as bumper member 32 referred to above)...FIG. 13 illustrates the joint or connection between a subframe system and a frame structure. A completed joint is indicated by the reference numeral 69, while an exploded view of the joint structure is indicated by the reference numeral 71. A U-shaped node structure 72 is used to connect a torque box member 73 on the SUV body structure to a rail member 34 or 36 of a subframe structure. The node structure 72 includes a U-shaped joint member 72' which is welded to the rail member 34 or 36, and a U-shaped joint member 72" which is welded to the torque box member 73. The two joint members 72' and 72" are bolted together in order to hold the subframe system to the body structure. The node structure 72 is preferably made of steel components which can either be stamped or hydroformed...For light truck structures, the system for connecting the body structure, frame structure (22 and 22') and front subframe system together uses a W-shaped member formed in the bottom of the body structure. The side rail members (60 and 62) are welded to the W-shaped member and a torque box member. The torque box member in turn is welded to a U-shaped joint member (like member 72"), which is bolted to a U-shaped joint member connected (welded) to the rail members of the front subframe system. The W-shaped member can be stamped or cast...The use of common components in the subframe systems for both the front and rear portions of a sport utility vehicle and for the front portions of both the SUV and light truck structures provides a significant advantage in the manufacture and assembly of the vehicles. With common components, the investment necessary for tooling to produce the components is significantly reduced. The cost of the components themselves, as well as the expense of manufacturing them, are also reduced. In addition, the time needed to assemble and connect the various components together to form the subframe systems and the time necessary to incorporate the subframe systems into the vehicle, are also significantly reduced...The front suspension systems utilize the same components and are also the same for the sport utility vehicles and the light truck vehicles in accordance with the present invention. In addition, the front and rear suspension systems for the sport utility vehicle have the same components and are substantially the same...In this regard, the preferred front suspension system used with the SUV and light truck vehicles in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIGS. 14 and 15.

The mounting bracket 118 includes a pair of support plates 119 and a pair of U-shaped bolts 121...The rear suspension systems for the light truck vehicles generally use a live axle with leaf springs, hydraulic shocks, and anti-roll bars. This type of rear suspension system is standard on light truck vehicles. This is due to the nature of the use of the truck, and its capabilities off-road, its durability, and its load carrying capacity...The suspension systems in accordance with the present invention provide a satisfactory ride and handling compromise for the package space utilized in the vehicles. The inventive suspension system also allows the suspension system to be mounted directly to the subframe systems for ease of installation and offline adjustment. Anti-sway bars (not shown) could also be utilized with either the front or rear suspension systems if desired...The SUV and light truck vehicles have a common steering system also. The steering system 130 is a conventional rack and pinion system and is shown in FIG. 19. The steering system 130 includes a steering wheel 132 connected to an intermediate shaft member 134 and a steering rack member 136. It is understood that any conventional steering system can be used with the vehicles in accordance with the present invention...A powertrain system which can be used with the SUV and light truck vehicles is shown in FIG. 20. Again, the same powertrain can be used with all of the vehicle structures 10, 20, and 30. The powertrain system 150 includes a transmission 152, a transfer case 154, a drive shaft 156, a rear differential 158, and a front differential 160, together with a front wheel drive shaft 162. Axle members 164 transfer the power from the engine through the drivetrain to the wheels of the vehicle...As shown in FIG. 20, preferably a four-wheel drive powertrain system is used for the SUVs and light truck vehicles in accordance with the present invention. However, it is also possible to utilize a two-wheel drive powertrain system. Moreover, the powertrain system used in the present invention can be of any conventional type...Any type of conventional transmission system can be used, such as a five-speed transmission with transfer case, or a five-speed automatic transmission with viscous coupling. Similarly, the engine 15 used with the vehicle can be any of the V-6 or V-8 engines in use today, and can even be a 4-cylinder engine, if desired...FIG. 21 shows the outline of a SUV and illustrates how the front and rear subframe systems and front and rear suspension systems are positioned in the vehicle. The front subframe system 14 is used to support the engine 15, while the rear subframe system 16 is used to support the rear differential 158.

The front and rear suspension systems 80 and 80', respectively, are attached as chassis 170, together with the powertrain components and engine 15. A radiator 172 is also shown in association with the engine 15. A torsional bar mounting cross beam 174 is attached to the underbody of the body member 12 and used to connect the torsion bar springs to the vehicle in the front and rear suspension systems...Another aspect of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 29 and 30. The unique framing structure for the SUV provides two triangulation systems which provide acceptable rigidity and strength while reducing the number of components and reducing weight and mass in the vehicle. In the front portion of the vehicle structure 10, the side rail members 34 and 36, together with cowl struts 40, form a triangular structure with the two "A" pillars 180. This triangular structure, which is indicated by the reference numeral 182, distributes loads throughout the body member 12 and vehicle structure in order to absorb crash loads and other loads on the bumper member 32 or front end of the vehicle...A second triangular structure 184 is provided in the rear portion of the SUV. The upper rail members 34 and 36 of the rear subframe system 16, in combination with the "C" pillars 186 and "D" pillars 188 form the triangular structure 184. The triangular structure 184 distributes loads throughout the body member 12 and associated vehicle structure. With this structure, a shock tower is not needed for the rear wheels of the vehicle...With the present invention and the use of a significant number of common components and common subsystems, the manufacture of sport utility vehicles and light truck vehicles can be accomplished on the same production line. This also saves tooling and assembly expenses and time relative to production of these two types of vehicles...As indicated above, the body member and structure of the three vehicles is preferably a monocoque structure in the center of the vehicles. Monocoque structures have less mass and weight than conventional frame structures for vehicles. Thus, the use of a monocoque structure for the center section of the SUV and light truck vehicles minimizes weight and cost of them...The material used for the SUV and light truck vehicles is preferably a steel material. The structures are designed as load bearing systems. All torsional and bending loads are contained within the structure...Some of the principle features of the present invention are that the front subframe strut joint is integrated into the upper member of the "A" pillar and the cowl joint. There also is a smooth transition of the load path from the front subframe strut through the roof rail of the body members. The body structure for the vehicles is also common for all of them from the "B" pillar forward. There also is a continuous roof rail section from the "A" pillar to the "D" pillar. The triangular structures 184 which utilize the "C" and "D" pillars provide for optimum loading through the roof rail of the body members...Moreover, an overlapping closed section front header is preferably used for increased torsional rigidity. Overlapping, closed section roof bows with bracket attachments are also used for the continuous roof rail section, thereby increasing the torsional and bending rigidities. The closed "D" pillar section from the floor of the body member to the header is also provided for increased body stiffness without adding significant mass or weight. A closed section "Jacking Brace" is supplied to distribute loads upward through the "D" pillar to the "C" pillar and the roof bow joint. Finally, overlapping members in the rear floor and the roof rail increase bending and torsional rigidity with minimum impact on mass...The wishbone mounts for the suspension system in accordance with the present invention are located on the upper and lower portions of the side rail members of the subframe systems in both the front and rear of the SUV. This is accomplished since the front and rear suspension systems for the SUV are the same. Also, the mounting of the engine 15 and the rear differential 158 share the same location on the front and rear subframe systems. In this regard, the same subframe systems are used for the SUV in the front and rear of the vehicle with only minor modifications being necessary for the different attachment locations...The mounting of the vehicle structure to the side rails is accomplished by rubber mounting for vehicle isolation and durability. Rubber mounting systems are conventionally known in the automobile industry. This type of mounting system provides isolation to the structure from road noise and vibration that is transmitted through the chassis frame...With the present invention, a more efficient design of a light truck vehicle and a sport utility vehicle are provided, with particular emphasis on mass, structural rigidity, cost, and crash performance. In this regard, vehicles made in accordance with the present invention are comparable to or exceed standards for known vehicles today with regard to people and mechanical package, towing capacity, safety, mass, structural rigidity, cost, and crash performance...Computer analysis of baseline structures having the structural configurations described above were secured. For the crash analysis, selected tests were performed to verify that the vehicle body, as designed, met the targets of performance and functionality. In particular, the analytical crash testing involved a simulated front crash test, rear crash test, roof crush test, and side impact test. The crash testing was accomplished by computer simulation using Cray computers and Livermore LS Dyna3D software, although other suitable software and hardware could be utilized. A high level of detail of the surfaces, welding, and mounting locations was imputed in order to provide the best possible resolution required to describe the crash events...A progressive crush of the vehicle was desired with all parts being crushed in sequence from the crash test. In stack up, the rigid bodies in the vehicle were designed to limit the crush and provide component integrity. The front crash analysis was set up in accordance with a test designed by the National Highway and Traffic Safety Association. The roof crush analysis was based on United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standards. For the rear crash test, the analysis was based on United States Rear Moving Barrier tests. The conditions for the side impact crash analysis were based on the European Side Moving Barrier tests...The body structures (body-in-white) in accordance with the present invention were designed to meet structural performance targets and to meet certain functional and performance targets. The functional performance targets include the overall package, crash analysis, and assembly for mass production. The functional performance targets with respect to the package include the wheel base, interior room, weight, and the like. These considerations are also taken into account during the structural performance design aspects...As mentioned above, the invention, as disclosed and described herein, is particularly related to the design and development of a sports utility vehicle (SUV) and a light truck structure (standard cab and extended cab). Vehicles of the SUV type include the Ford Explorer the Chevrolet Blazer, the Toyota 4 Runner, and the Jeep Cherokee. These all contain V-6 or V-8 engines ard are four-wheel drive. Vehicles today which are comparable to light truck structures include the Ford Ranger, Chevy S-10, Toyota Tacoma and Dodge Dakota...In addition, certain structural performance targets were selected for the SUV and light truck vehicle structures. These targets included a certain mass or weight, certain static torsion and bending standards, and certain modes of vibration (frequency)...As indicated above, all of the structural and performance standards can be met with a sport utility vehicle or light truck vehicle made in accordance with the present invention. In addition, the present invention provides significant cost savings due to the use of common components and subsystems, both in tooling investment and assembly time and expense...Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing detailed description, it is to be understood that the present invention is not to be limited to just the embodiments disclosed, but that they are capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the scope of the claims hereafter.

 Polymorphisms in Genes Involved in Folate Metabolism as Maternal Risk Factors for Down Syndrome
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707632492

[]

, September 2000, Pages 623?630..Down syndrome is a complex genetic and metabolic disorder attributed to the presence of three copies of chromosome 21. The extra chromosome derives from the mother in 93% of cases and is due to abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis (nondisjunction). Except for advanced age at conception, maternal risk factors for meiotic nondisjunction are not well established. A recent preliminary study suggested that abnormal folate metabolism and the 677C?T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene may be maternal risk factors for Down syndrome. The present study was undertaken with a larger sample size to determine whether the MTHFR 677C?T polymorphism was associated with increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is another enzyme essential for normal folate metabolism. A common polymorphism in this gene was recently associated with increased risk of neural tube defects and might also contribute to increased risk for Down syndrome. The frequencies of the MTHFR 677C?T and MTRR 66A?G mutations were evaluated in DNA samples from 157 mothers of children with Down syndrome and 144 control mothers. Odds ratios were calculated for each genotype separately and for potential gene-gene interactions. The results are consistent with the preliminary observation that the MTHFR 677C?T polymorphism is more prevalent among mothers of children with Down syndrome than among control mothers, with an odds ratio of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19?3.05). In addition, the homozygous MTRR 66A?G polymorphism was independently associated with a 2.57-fold increase in estimated risk (95% CI 1.33?4.99). The combined presence of both polymorphisms was associated with a greater risk of Down syndrome than was the presence of either alone, with an odds ratio of 4.08 (95% CI 1.94?8.56). The two polymorphisms appear to act without a multiplicative interaction...Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome, is the most common genetic cause of human mental retardation, with an incidence of ?1/600?1,000 live births (Smith and Berg ..). In addition, trisomy 21 is a major cause of premature pregnancy failure. It is estimated that 1/150 conceptions have trisomy 21 and that 80% of these are lost during early pregnancy (Boue et al. ..; Hassold and Jacobs ..; Freeman et al. ..). The nondisjunction event that results in two copies of chromosome 21 takes place in anaphase of meiosis I, during oocyte maturation before ovulation, and/or in anaphase of meiosis II, around the time of fertilization in the adult female (Lemaire-Adkins et al. ..; Picton et al. ..; Hunt and Lemaire-Adkins ..). Despite the prevalence and health consequences of Down syndrome, the biochemical and molecular basis for meiotic nondisjunction is not understood...Folic acid is essential for the de novo synthesis of nucleotide precursors for normal DNA synthesis and is also essential for normal cellular methylation reactions. Chronic folate/methyl deficiency in vivo and in vitro has been associated with abnormal DNA methylation (Balaghi and Wagner ..; Pogribny et al. ..; Fowler et al. ..; Jacob et al. ..), DNA strand breaks (Blount et al. ..; Pogribny et al. ..; Duthie ..), altered chromosome recombination (Knuutila et al. ..; MacGregor et al. ..), and aberrant chromosome segregation (Libbus et al. ..; Leyton et al. ..; Chen et al. ..; Titenko-Holland et al. ..; Xu et al. ..) On the basis of this evidence, James et al. (..) suggested the possibility that gene-nutrient interactions associated with abnormal folate metabolism and DNA hypomethylation might increase the risk of chromosome nondisjunction. In this preliminary study, mothers of children with Down syndrome were found to have mildly elevated plasma homocysteine levels and a 2.6-fold increased frequency of the 677C?T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, compared with control mothers (95% CI 1.2?5.8). The data from this study further suggested that polymorphisms in other genes in the folate pathway may increase the risk of having a child with Down syndrome (James et al. ..; Rosenblatt ..)...MTHFR catalyzes the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the methyl donor for the B..-dependent remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via the methionine synthase reaction (..). Methionine is the precursor for the synthesis of ..-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major cellular methyl donor for DNA, RNA, protein, and phospholipid methylation. The reduction in enzyme activity associated with the 677C?T MTHFR polymorphism raises the dietary requirement for folic acid to maintain normal remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (Bailey and Gregory  ..). Consequently, low folate status in individuals with the MTHFR polymorphism results in an increase in homocysteine and a decrease in methionine levels. Chronic elevation in intracellular homocysteine can lead to a decrease in the ratio of SAM to ..-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) that is associated with inhibition of the DNA methyltransferase and DNA hypomethylation (Balaghi and Wagner  ..; De Cabo et al. ..; Melnyk et al. ..) Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is a related flavoprotein that maintains the methionine synthase enzyme in an active state for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The cloning of the cDNA for MTRR led to the identification of a polymorphism, 66A?G, that was recently associated with increased risk for spina bifida (LeClerc et al. ..; Wilson et al. ..). Because of the importance of the methionine synthase reaction in maintaining normal folate metabolism and DNA methylation, we hypothesized that this polymorphism could be a second maternal genetic risk factor for Down syndrome...No articles found...This article has not been cited...No articles found.

RadioGraphics: Tuberculosis: A Radiologic Review
http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/rg.275065176

[]

Tuberculosis has shown a resurgence in nonendemic populations in recent years, a phenomenon that has been attributed to factors such as increased migration and the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. Although the thorax is most frequently involved, tuberculosis may involve any of a number of organ systems (eg, the respiratory, cardiac, central nervous, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems), and timely diagnosis of the disease is paramount, since delayed treatment is associated with severe morbidity. Unfortunately, a history of infection with or exposure to tuberculosis may or may not be present, and evidence of active tuberculosis is present in less than 50% of cases. A negative tuberculin skin test does not in itself exclude infection. Furthermore, the clinical and radiologic features of tuberculosis may mimic those of many other diseases. Therefore, although in many cases biopsy or culture specimens are required to make the definitive diagnosis, it is imperative that radiologists and clinicians understand the typical distribution, patterns, and imaging manifestations of tuberculosis...?

 Increased expression of proteasome subunits in skeletal muscle of cancer patients with weight loss
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272504003929

[]

, October 2005, Pages 2196?2206..Muscle Wasting: From Molecular Regulation to Novel Therapies..Edited By P-O. Hasselgren and D. Attaix..Atrophy of skeletal muscle is common in patients with cancer and results in increased morbidity and mortality. In order to design effective therapy the mechanism by which this occurs needs to be elucidated. Most studies suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is most important in intracellular proteolysis, although there have been no reports on the activity of this pathway in patients with different extents of weight loss. In this report the expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in rectus abdominis muscle has been determined in cancer patients with weight loss of 0?34% using a competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure expression of mRNA for proteasome subunits C2 and C5, while protein expression has been determined by western blotting. Overall, both C2 and C5 gene expression was increased by about three-fold in skeletal muscle of cachectic cancer patients (average weight loss 14.5???2.5%), compared with that in patients without weight loss, with or without cancer. The level of gene expression was dependent on the amount of weight loss, increasing maximally for both proteasome subunits in patients with weight loss of 12?19%. Further increases in weight loss reduced expression of mRNA for both proteasome subunits, although it was still elevated in comparison with patients with no weight loss. There was no evidence for an increase in expression at weight losses less than 10%. There was a good correlation between expression of proteasome 20S? subunits, detected by western blotting, and C2 and C5 mRNA, showing that increased gene expression resulted in increased protein synthesis. Expression of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, E2.., with weight loss followed a similar pattern to that of proteasome subunits. These results suggest variations in the expression of key components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway with weight loss of cancer patients, and suggest that another mechanism of protein degradation must be operative for patients with weight loss less than 10%...Copyright ? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

 The Principle of Least Nuclear Motion
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065316008601173

[]

, 1978, Pages 1?61..Edited By V. Gold and D. Bethel1..This chapter outlines the principle of least nuclear motion (PLNM). The principle of least motion, states that those elementary reactions will be favored that involve the least change in atomic position and electronic configuration. Thus, the principle of least motion deals with reactivity in terms of the reactant(s) and product(s) of the reaction. When product stability effects have been accounted for, the residue will contain the PLNM effects, but it will also contain asynchronization effects and effects of differences in changes in electronic configuration. The chapter discusses the principle qualitatively in terms of the intersecting Morse curve approach. Further attention to motion toward the transition state instead of toward the product may be valuable. The effect of imperfect synchronization of changes and of non-monotonic changes taking place during a reaction should also be studied further...Copyright ? 1977 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.

SIRT6 Promotes DNA Repair Under Stress by Activating PARP1 | Science
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6036/1443

[]

You are currently viewing the abstract...Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a mammalian homolog of the yeast Sir2 deacetylase. Mice deficient for SIRT6 exhibit genome instability. Here, we show that in mammalian cells subjected to oxidative stress SIRT6 is recruited to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and stimulates DSB repair, through both nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination. Our results indicate that SIRT6 physically associates with poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)?ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and mono-ADP-ribosylates PARP1 on lysine residue 521, thereby stimulating PARP1 poly-ADP-ribosylase activity and enhancing DSB repair under oxidative stress...Vol 332, Issue 6036..17 June 2011 ..Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science...NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

A statistically                     defined sample of 3CR radio galaxies has been selected and the radio properties of those galaxies with and without strong                     emission lines contrasted. For intrinsically weak radio galaxies, having radio luminosities at 178 MHz .., only about 10 per cent possess strong emission-line spectra (class A spectra), whereas for greater luminosities about 50                     per cent are of this type. At the highest radio luminosities, .., over 70 per cent of the radio galaxies possess class A spectra. For sources of the same total radio luminosity, the radio                     luminosities of the central components are not found to be different for galaxies with and without strong emission-line spectra.                     However, the strongest central components are associated with galaxies having class A spectra and, for these, there is a correlation                     between the fraction of the radio luminosity originating in the central component and the breadth of the permitted recombination                     lines. The class A radio galaxies are almost exclusively classical double radio sources, whereas those galaxies without strong                     emission lines (class B spectra) are associated with radio sources of all morphological types. The physical sizes of the radio                     sources associated with class A radio galaxies are greater than those of class B. Cluster membership is also found to be correlated                     with optical spectral type.                  .. These findings are analysed in terms of the beam model of double radio sources and current pictures of the distribution of                     gas in active nuclei. The problems of accounting for the optical spectral properties of radio galaxies are contrasted with                     those of Seyfert galaxies. It is suggested that radio galaxies are systems in which a steady state has been reached which                     persists for periods .. yr, and it may be only for the most massive galaxies that such steady conditions can be set up.                  ..Search this journal:..You are viewing MNRAS - switch to ...                     ..                        ..                                             ..Looking for jobs.....Disclaimer: Please note that abstracts for content published before 1996 were                   created through digital scanning and may therefore not exactly                   replicate the text of the original print issues.

Analysis of DNA in fresh and fixed tissue by the polymerase chain reaction.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1877479/

[]

..The NCBI web site requires JavaScript to function. ....The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify viral or oncogene sequences from frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Methods for preparing fixed, embedded colonic tissue for PCR amplification of c-K-ras sequences from genomic DNA and for amplification of viral DNA from other tissues, including brain, lung, and liver, were evaluated. The effect of formalin fixation on the efficiency of amplification was also determined. While there seemed to be only a modest variation in the efficiency of the PCR for amplification of single-copy human genes, regardless of the methods used for tissue preparation, amplification of viral DNA sequences against a human genomic DNA background was more efficient when the DNA was purified to some degree before amplification of the tissue. We used the PCR to examine frozen and fixed embedded tissue sections for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA. One patient with a heart-lung transplant succumbed to a lymphoproliferative disorder, and EBV genome was present in tissues with abnormal lymphoid infiltrates. CMV was also present in bronchial lavages from the same patient, where cytologic diagnosis was not apparent. Another patient with a liver transplant showed CMV genome in multiple liver biopsies, with negative histologic results for CMV. In vitro DNA amplification with the PCR demonstrated sensitivity superior to that of histology in detecting CMV and EBV in the cases examined...                .. ..                ..

 Modelling of the energy absorption by polymer composites upon ballistic impact
 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266353800001391

[]

, November 2000, Pages 2631?2642..In this paper we report on the development of a simple model for calculating the energy absorption by polymer composites upon ballistic impact. Three major components were identified as contributing to the energy lost by the projectile during ballistic impact, namely the energy absorbed in tensile failure of the composite, the energy converted into elastic deformation of the composite and the energy converted into the kinetic energy of the moving portion of the composite. These three contributions are combined in the model to determine a value for the ballistic limit of the composite, ... The required input parameters for the model were determined by a combination of physical characterisation (for the physical and mechanical properties of the composites and the characteristics of the projectile) and from high-speed photography (for the size of the deformed region and the cone velocity). As the failure event usually occurred between two of a relatively small number of frames from the high-speed camera, the model predicted a range for ... This range of .. was compared with experimentally determined values for three composite systems: woven Nylon-66 fibres in a 50:50 mixture of phenol formaldehyde resin and polyvinyl butyral resin, woven aramid fibres in a similar matrix and Dyneema UD66 (straight gel-spun polyethylene fibres laid in a 0/90 fibre arrangement in a thermoplastic matrix). In all cases, the experimentally measured values of .. were found to lie within the range predicted by the model. The size of the deformed region, formed through shear deformation, on the back face of the composite was found to relate directly to the in-plane shear modulus of the material. Perhaps the most surprising result was that the dominant energy absorbing mechanism was found to be the kinetic energy of the moving portion of the composites...Reproduced with the permission of the Controller of Her Majesty's Stationary Office...Crown copyright ? 2000 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental Costs of Freshwater Eutrophication in England and Wales - Environmental Science & Technology (ACS Publications)
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es020793k

[]

Eutrophication has many known consequences, but there are few data on the environmental and health costs. We developed a new framework of cost categories that assess both social and ecological damage costs and policy response costs. These findings indicate the severe effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication on many sectors of the economy. We estimate the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication in England and Wales to be $105?160 million yr.. (?75.0?114.3 m). The policy response costs are a measure of how much is being spent to address this damage, and these amount to $77 million yr.. (?54.8 m). The damage costs are dominated by seven items each with costs of $15 million yr.. or more:? reduced value of waterfront dwellings, drinking water treatment costs for nitrogen removal, reduced recreational and amenity value of water bodies, drinking water treatment costs for removal of algal toxins and decomposition products, reduced value of nonpolluted atmosphere, negative ecological effects on biota, and net economic losses from the tourist industry. In common with other environmental problems, it would represent net value (or cost reduction) if damage was prevented at source. A variety of effective economic, regulatory, and administrative policy instruments are available for internalizing these costs. ..Citation data is made available by participants in ..

High-molecular-mass hyaluronan mediates the cancer resistance of the naked mole rat :  Nature :  Nature Publishing Group
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v499/n7458/abs/nature12234.html

The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) displays exceptional longevity, with a maximum lifespan exceeding 30[thinsp]years. This is the longest reported lifespan for a rodent species and is especially striking considering the small body mass of the naked mole rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house mouse has a maximum lifespan of 4[thinsp]years. In addition to their longevity, naked mole rats show an unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat colonies did not detect a single incidence of cancer. Here we identify a mechanism responsible for the naked mole rat/'s cancer resistance. We found that naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HA), which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA. This high-molecular-mass HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole-rat tissues owing to the decreased activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA signalling, as they have a higher affinity to HA compared with mouse or human cells. Perturbation of the signalling pathways sufficient for malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform naked mole-rat cells. However, once high-molecular-mass HA is removed by either knocking down HAS2 or overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, HYAL2, naked mole-rat cells become susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumours in mice. We speculate that naked mole rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the skin to provide skin elasticity needed for life in underground tunnels. This trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer resistance and longevity to this species.

Now a novel glycosaminoglycan variant that may have evolved to provide the creatures with the tough, flexible skin needed for a subterranean lifestyle has been identified as a key contributor to their cancer resistance. Hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid, is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix. Xiao Tian ... observed that the culture media of naked mole-rat fibroblasts becomes viscous owing to the accumulation of a thick 'gooey' substance and identified it as a high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HMM-HA), more than five times larger than mouse and human equivalents. It accumulates in naked mole-rat tissues owing to low hyaluronidase activity and a unique form of hyaluronan synthase 2. HMM-HA acts through the CD44 receptor and removal of HMM-HA makes naked mole-rat cells more susceptible to transformation. This unusual model of cancer protection suggests potential new avenues of research into anticancer and life-extension strategies...Image credit: Illustration by Andy Potts; Photo: Chris Goodfellow/Gladstone Inst...London, United Kingdom..Saxtons River, VT, United States..Hinxton, United Kingdom.. .... .... .... .. .. .... ....
